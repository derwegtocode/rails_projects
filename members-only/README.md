Your Task
The projects will be less and less explicit about how to achieve their goals, since we expect you to build on your previous knowledge. If you don’t know how to do something, feel free to check back in previous lessons or projects or Google the correct way to implement it (though be careful, because that may take you deeper down the road than we intended).

If you’d like to challenge yourself, don’t even follow the steps below, just go ahead and build the app!
